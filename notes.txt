# Complete Building & Publishing Recommendation

- Compile from scratch using docker and build.sh and doxygen docs
- Generate types
- Test using OpenCVâ€™s node test
- Test using node scripts at '/test'
- Try node types validity in playground
- Increment all versions
    - package
    - package-lock
    - README installation
- Dry run NPM module - npm link and test on separate project, see if the type is working.
- If package is working fine, then tag it.
- Publish NPM module
